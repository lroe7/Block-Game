# BlockGameProject

/*TO DO

1) Add a score that changes each time a block is hit. Display it in the upper
left corner of the screen.
2) Check to see if all of the blocks have been destroyed and if they have been
display a "You Win" message.
3) Extend a block to make a new type of block that acts differently than a
regular block. Must be different than the other people in your group.
4) Extend the block that you extended in 3) that does something similar to
your block but different.
5) Make a GameObject that implements Movable (could be one of your blocks,
does not have to be.)
6) Create your own interface and implement it. Can be combined with other
tasks (like your block) but does not have to be.

Optional advanced ideas:
1) Make a demo mode that plays by itself.
2) Instead of displaying a "You Win" message display a "Level Complete"
message and start over with a harder level.
3) Let the player choose the difficult of various parts of the game (paddle
size, paddle speed, ball size, ball speed, etc.).
4) Implement Powerups that give you a better paddle (shoots, larger, faster,
two paddles, etc.) or a better ball (travels through blocks instead of
bouncing off, bigger, slower, etc.)/*
